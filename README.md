MVC Coloring Book

This repo contains the source for MVC Coloring Book. MVC Coloring Book is an online coloring book application written in ASP.NET MVC and HTML5/JS. You can specify a URL and the image from the URL will be downloaded and saved to the server then shown in the view for the user to color.

The coloring mechanism uses a flood fill algorithm to fill in all the space between black lines. So, you simply need to select the color and click on the image somewhere to fill that section with the corresponding color.
